Expeditions are the primary engine for generating wealth. Unlike active tasks, your earnings scale based on real-world time and the specific skills of the characters you own.

### Setting the Squad
Your Expedition Squad is separate from your Battle Squad. You can assign up to 5 characters to this roster.

**The Setup Command**
Use `!set_expedition` (or `!se`) followed by the unique IDs from your inventory.
> `!se 102 45 8 201 55`

### Managing the Mission
Once your team is assigned, use the `!ex` subcommands to handle the mission:

- **!ex start**: Begins the expedition timer.
- **!ex status**: Checks your current elapsed time and estimated gem yield.
- **!ex claim**: Ends the mission and deposits gems. 

<Warning>
  Missions must run for a minimum of 60 seconds. Claiming early will result in 0 gems and reset your timer.
</Warning>

### The Multiplier Meta
Your final payout is calculated by stacking three distinct types of bonuses.

**Active Skill: Hardworker**
- **Bonus**: +15% per unit.
- **Requirement**: The character must be physically assigned to the Expedition Squad.
- **Effect**: If 5 units with this skill are deployed, you gain a +75% bonus.

**Global Skill: Master of Coin**
- **Bonus**: +10% per unit.
- **Requirement**: None. This is a passive global buff.
- **Effect**: As long as these units are in your inventory, the bonus stacks. You do not need to deploy them.

**Time Bonus: The Long Road**
- **Bonus**: Scales up to +24%.
- **Requirement**: Time elapsed.
- **Effect**: Efficiency increases hourly. To reach the maximum 24% bonus, the expedition must run for a full 24 hours.
