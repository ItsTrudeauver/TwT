### Combat Tasks
The bot provides a tiered system of NPC challenges. To receive these rewards, you must first defeat the NPC in battle and then manually claim the bounty.

**The Workflow**
1. View available challenges: `!tasks`
2. Enter the fight: `!battle <difficulty>`
3. Secure the gems: `!claim <difficulty>`

**Reward Breakdown**
- **Easy**: 500 Gems (Requires defeating 5 R-Rank units).
- **Normal**: 1,000 Gems (Requires defeating 3 R and 2 SR units).
- **Hard**: 1,500 Gems (Requires defeating 5 SR-Rank units).
- **Expert**: 2,500 Gems (Requires defeating 2 SSR and 3 SR units).
- **Hell**: 5,000 Gems (Requires defeating the top 50 ranked SSR units).

<Note>
  All tasks reset every 24 hours. You must complete the battle before the claim command will function.
