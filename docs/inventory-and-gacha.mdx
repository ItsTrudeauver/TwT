### Pulling Units
Gacha pulls are the only way to acquire new units and find characters with the "Master of Coin" global buff.

- **!pull 1**: Costs 1,000 Gems.
- **!pull 10**: Costs 10,000 Gems.
- **!starter**: A one-time command that gives new players 10 units (1 guaranteed SSR).
- **!banner**: Displays the current rate-up characters and the expiration time of the current event.

### Inventory Management
With a 5,000+ character database, your inventory will fill up quickly. Managing the "In and Out" is vital.

**Protecting Assets**
Before cleaning your inventory, lock your most valuable units (SSRs and those with Master of Coin).
- **!lock <id>**: Prevents the unit from being scrapped.
- **!unlock <id>**: Removes protection.
- **!view <id>**: Shows the character's art, rarity, and skill tags.

**The Mass Scrap (The "Out")**
Use the `!mass_scrap` (or `!ms`) command to instantly clean your inventory.
- **Logic**: This command automatically deletes every **unlocked R-Rank unit** in your collection.
- **Payout**: You receive a partial gem refund for every unit scrapped.

<Warning>
  Always lock your R-rank units that have the **Master of Coin** skill. If they are unlocked, `!mass_scrap` will delete them, and you will lose your global passive income bonus.
